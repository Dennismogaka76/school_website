<p>A legion of fans led by a 'Chief Diviner' dressed in a blue robe decorated with a white colour moved around the pitch pelting lewd intimidating Luhya circumcision songs, perhaps a pointer to their desire to inflict pain on their opponents in the pitch.

Before the commencement of all matches, a number of weird 'rituals' were performed on the pitch by the obviously overzealous and hawk-eyed intercessors from Trans Nzoia. Nothing was left to chance as the bible-carrying adherents invoked the gods in their tough war with opponents from the other parts of Kenya at the games. 

Several chants and unintelligible prayers were submitted to the deities. Weird mock-penalties were taken to the sheer delight of the thousands of fans who thronged the Hill School grounds to be part of the soccer fiesta. 

There was a hilarious moment when a seemingly intoxicated semi-nude fan dashed into the middle of the pitch, made a few crazy dance moves, moved towards the opponent's goal with an imaginary ball, but as he was about to score, he fell with a thud near the penalty area! Perhaps this portended a bad omen to the team!



Determined to erase the sacrilegious move, another fan approached the man who had committed the sin, slapped him and send him off with a red card!

In the end, it was the super team spirit that won the day for St. Anthony of Kitale in the under 16 category.
